					<h3>Project Description</h3>
					<p>This project is a blog platform built around the principles of openness, creativity, and clarity. It uses JSON as the foundation for storing and rendering content, treating each post as structured data that is easy to manage, share, and evolve. The goal is to make publishing bother powerful and accessible. The front-end editor is designed to be intuitive and expressive. It draws inspiration from tools like Notion, allowing writers to organize their thoughts with headings, groupings, and clean formatting. In addition to standard text blocks, the editor supports embedded iframes, custom HTML, and JavaScript boxes. This gives creators the freedom to include interactive elements, visualizations, or live demos directly in their posts. Every piece of content is translated into JSON, capturing structure, layout, and embedded features. This ensures that the site can render posts and dynamically and consistently. It also opens the door to future enhancements like collaboration, version control, and API integration. The platform is built to encourage open communication and the free exchange of information. Writers are invited to share knowledge and ideas in a space that values transparency and thoughtful expression. Whether they're publishing tutorials, showcasing creative work, or exploring new concepts, this site is meant to support and amplify your voice.</p>

				<h3>License Rationale</h3>
				<p>For this project, I decided to go for the GNU GPLv3.0 license for its flexibility while promoting ethicality and integrity. I place a huge emphasis on open, free information and the reliability of data. These values should be reflected in all content, especially my own. By adopting GNU's license, I help propagate a mindset of transparency and shared knowledge. Because of its copyleft clause, I ensure that any derivative works must use the same license, reinforcing the accountability and openness. I believe that ethical development means empowering others to learn, build, and contribute freely, without barriers and  GNU's GPL license fully embodies this philosophy.</p>
